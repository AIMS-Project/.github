AIMSâ€™ mission is to understand stream intermittency and its implications for downstream water quality, which requires untangling the hydrologic, biogeochemical, and microbiome controls at the interface of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We will develop resources and tools to study intermittent streams, provide training and education in data science, mentor scientists from the undergraduate to the early career level, and generate insights for evidence-based policy making and land management.
