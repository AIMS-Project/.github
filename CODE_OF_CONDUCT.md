By participating in, and contributing to, the AIMS project, team members have made a 
commitment to each other and the interdisciplinary work that has been proposed. All team 
members are dedicated to creating a diverse, inclusive and collegi
al collaborative environment 
for our students, colleagues, and community stakeholders. Specific commitments by team 
members are outlined above in “AIMS Team Member Expectations”. In addition, all AIMS team 
members will follow guidelines and best practices 
outlined by NSF’s Responsible and ethical 
conduct of research (https://www.nsf.gov/od/recr.jsp).
